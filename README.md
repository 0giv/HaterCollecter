**Requirements:**\
Python3, Windows(x64)


## **Setup Guide:**
You will first need to register a bot with the Discord developer portal and then add the bot to the Discord server that you want to use to control the bot (make sure the bot has administrator privileges in the Discord server).
Once the bot is created copy the token of your bot and paste it at line 33.
<li>Add the relevant tokens to the HaterCollecter.py file under the "token =" fields.


Install requirements :
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Then if the steps above were successful, you can launch the python file by executing ```python HaterCollecter.py```. It will create a new channel and post a message on the server with a generated session number.\
Now your bot should be available to use ! 

If you want an exe file you need to install  ```pyinstaller```
